# Introduction

**VitePress I18n** is a plugin that automatically translates components of VitePress for the desired language.

It performs translations for the layout interface, system, and search interface of sites deployed with VitePress. All you need to do for this to work is a very simple setup!

With VitePress alone, you would have to provide and manage separate translation texts for each language, but with this plugin, you can use pre-translated sets to eliminate the hassle of having to do translations for each project. Of course, it will also reduce the amount of code.

The plugin does not currently translate VitePress documentation files directly, but supporting this when possible is something we may consider as a future roadmap.

- ⚡️ Optimized for the latest version of **VitePress**.
- ⚡️ Lightweight bundled file size, zero dependencies
- ⚡️ [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) Support
